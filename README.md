# Description
Our website is a local two-player Pokemon showdown game, where we use historical figures and superheroes as the characters using the Pantheon API and the Superheroes API. For the in-game stats, we will get data from those API’s and convert those info into in-game stats. Those stats with be assigned to moves from specific Pokemon and be given to the superheroes and historical figures.
