# Description
Our website is a local two-player Pokemon showdown game, where we use historical figures and superheroes as the characters using the Pantheon API and the Superheroes API. For the in-game stats we will draw on the Pokemon API and give the Superheroes and historical figures random moves from specific Pokemon.
