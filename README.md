# Description
Our website is a local two-player Pokemon showdown game, where we use anime characters and superheroes instead of Pokemons using the Jikan API and the Superheroes API. For the in-game stats, we will get data from those API’s and convert those info into in-game stats. Those stats with be assigned to random Pokemon moves and be given to the superheroes and anime characters.
